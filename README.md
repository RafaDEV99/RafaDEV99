# About me 🤔:
👋 Hi, I’m @RafaDEV99, a Spanish 🇪🇸 developer who is currently interested in programming cool projects, 
low-level programming with C, Rust, and more languages! I also sometimes like making small games to
practice my programming skills. I also like to collaborate on interesting projects and learn from them,
Currently, I'm working on the CrraBloom project (In Alpha, now).
